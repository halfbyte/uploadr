# Uploadr

Yes, most terrible name evar.

This is a quick and dirty hack to make uploading images for blog posts etc easier.

It allows for dragging and dropping images onto the page or (for mobile) manual upload.

It has a bunch of very halfbyte specific presets and uses mini_magick under the hood
to resize images on upload.
